A WordPress slideshow plugin fed from a SmugMug, Flickr, MobileMe, Picasa or Photobucket RSS feed and displayed using pure Javascript.

== Description ==

A WordPress slideshow plugin fed from a **SmugMug**, **Flickr**, **MobileMe**, **Picasa** or **Photobucket** RSS feed and displayed using pure Javascript.
Blip does not hardcode what it finds into your blog. Instead the most recent images are loaded in real-time by the user's web browser.

See it in live use at my <a href="http://www.ambientphotography.ca/" alt="Toronto Wedding Photographer">wedding photography</a> website.

> Please note that Blip is [*not* compatible with the Javascript framework Prototype](http://mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/00a-mootoolsvsothers). Please check for "prototype.js" in your webpage, included by your theme or other plugin, before contacting me for help.

Requires WordPress 2.7 and PHP 5.

== Installation ==

1. Download Blip Slideshow
1. Unzip and upload the resulting folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. *(Optional)* Enable caching in the 'Settings' menu in WordPress under 'Blip Slideshow'
1. Place the [slideshow] shortcode in your posts and/or pages. A theme template function call is also available.

**Detailed examples for use can be found at [the Blip homepage](http://www.jasonhendriks.com/programmer/blip-slideshow/)**.

*A simple SmugMug slideshow example:*

> [slideshow thumbnails=false rss=feed://www.smugmug.com/hack/feed.mg?Type=popular&Data=all&format=rss200&Size=Medium]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

Blip is a wrapper for [MooTools Slideshow 2!](http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/ 'Javascript MooTools Slideshow') by Aeron Glemann with some nifty client-side RSS-reading magic. If you like Blip, please show your support to him.

= What are the features? =

* Verified to work with SmugMug, Flickr, MobileMe, Picasa Web and Photobucket Media RSS Feeds
* Theoretically compatible with any Media RSS Feed
* WordPress templates load immediately; reading of Media RSS Feeds is performed in the background
* Supports server-side caching of Media RSS Feeds via a writable cache directory for extra performance (must be enabled in Settings)
* Supports client-side caching of Media RSS Feeds via HTTP 304 for extra performance (must be enabled in Settings)
* Supports multiple slideshows in a single post/page
* Supports Lightbox plugins such as [Lightbox Plus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightbox-plus/), [jQuery Colorbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jquery-colorbox/), [jQuery Lightbox For Native Galleries](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jquery-lightbox-for-native-galleries/), [Slimbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slimbox/), [WP-Slimbox2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-slimbox2/) and [Gameplorer's WPColorBox](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gameplorers-wpcolorbox/)

= What is Media RSS? =

[Media RSS (MRSS)](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss) is an RSS extension used for syndicating multimedia files (audio, video, image) in RSS feeds. Like your WordPress
RSS news feed, media RSS lists pictures instead of articles from photo-sharing websites.

= Where can I find my RSS feed URL? =

* SmugMug has a [Help](http://www.smugmug.com/help/rss-atom-feeds "How to subscribe to RSS feeds") page and some [examples](http://wiki.smugmug.net/display/SmugMug/Feeds+Examples).
* Flickr has a [Help](http://www.flickr.com/get_the_most.gne#rss "How to use RSS and Atom Feeds") page. Also worth checking out is DeGrave.com's [Flickr RSS Feed Generator](http://www.degraeve.com/flickr-rss/).
* Picasa Web has a [Using RSS Feeds](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47351) page and a [Creating custom RSS feeds](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99373) page.
* Photobucket has a [Help](http://pic.pbsrc.com/dev_help/RSS/Photobucket_RSS_Feeds.htm "Photobucket RSS Feeds") page.
* For MobileMe, click the "Subscribe" icon found at the top of your MobileMe gallery on the MobileMe website. Note: This icon is on the *public* version of your gallery (gallery.me.com). Not the version you see when you are logged in (www.me.com).

= Known Issues =

* Blip is [*not* compatible with the Javascript framework Prototype](http://mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/00a-mootoolsvsothers). Please check for "prototype.js" in your webpage, included by your theme or other plugin, before contacting me for help.
* Although multiple slideshows per page are possible, only Colorbox plugins support two or more of those slideshows having a Lightbox.
* [Slideshow type "Fold" does not work in Internet Explorer](http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/issues/detail?id=195).
